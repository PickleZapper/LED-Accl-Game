# LED-Accl-Game
A little game I programmed using an 8x8 LED matrix and accelerometer.

## Components Used
* 1 x Arduino Uno R3
* 1 x MPU-6050
* 1 x 8x8 LED Matrix
* 1 x Four-Digit Seven-Segment Display
* 1 x 74HC595 Serial-to-Parallel Shift Register
* 1 x Button
* 6 x 330 Ohm Resistor
* 2 x LED
* Lots of Jumpers
## Problems
 * Documentation kinda sucks
 * Not sure if it should use busy while loops or allow for parallel tasks
 * Functions kinda suck (The functions do too much and not enough at the same time)
 * Button input should probably use interrupts (but I don't know how to... yet)
